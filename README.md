# Waste-Segregator-AI
Waste Segregater AI is an AI-powered waste classification system designed to simplify and automate the process of waste segregation. This project leverages machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to categorize waste into different classes, contributing to smarter waste management practices. The model is trained on a dataset containing 64,990 images of various waste types, and is still in its early stages of development.

While the current model achieves a moderate accuracy of around 68%, the project is actively evolving. Continuous improvements in data quality, model architecture, and performance optimization are being made. User contributions and feedback will be crucial in helping the project achieve its full potential.

Key Features
Image Classification: Uses CNNs to classify waste images into predefined categories.
Scalable Dataset: Built on a growing dataset of 64,990 images, with plans to expand as more data is contributed by users.
Early Stage Performance: The model is still in the process of refinement, with a current accuracy of 68%.
Open Source: Contributions are welcome from the community to help improve the modelâ€™s performance, scalability, and efficiency.
Why Waste Segregation Matters
Waste segregation is essential for proper recycling and disposal. Effective waste segregation can reduce environmental harm, conserve resources, and improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By leveraging AI, Waste Segregater AI aims to make this process faster and more efficient, leading to better waste handling across various sectors, including households, industries, and municipalities.
